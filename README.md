# Loan Approval Prediction

This repository contains the solution for the Loan Approval Prediction competition on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). The goal of this project is to predict whether a loan will be approved or not based on the provided features.

## Project Overview
This project aims to use machine learning algorithms to predict loan approval status. It includes:
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering.
- Training a model to predict loan approval.
- Evaluating the model's performance using accuracy and other metrics.
- Preparing a submission file for the competition.

## Data Description
The dataset includes the following files:
- **train.csv**: Contains the training data with labeled target values.
- **test.csv**: Contains the test data without labels. This is the data you will use to make predictions.
- **sample_submission.csv**: An example of the submission file format.

### Features
The dataset contains various features that can be used for predicting loan approval status, such as:
- `Gender`
- `Married`
- `Dependents`
- `Education`
- `Self_Employed`
- `ApplicantIncome`
- `CoapplicantIncome`
- `LoanAmount`
- `Loan_Amount_Term`
- `Credit_History`
- `Property_Area`
- `Loan_Status` (target variable in `train.csv`)

## Installation
To run the code, you need the following Python libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install the required libraries using:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Model Training
The model training process includes:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize numerical features.
2. **Model Selection**: Multiple algorithms were tested, including logistic regression, random forest, and gradient boosting.
3. **Cross-Validation**: Used k-fold cross-validation to evaluate the models' performance.
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimized model hyperparameters using grid search or randomized search for the best results.

## Prediction
Once the model is trained, it is used to predict loan approval status on the test dataset:
```python
predictions = model3.predict(test_trf)  # Use predict() method instead of calling the model

# Assuming 'id' is defined; you need to ensure it has the same length as predictions
output = pd.DataFrame({'id': id, 'loan_status': predictions})

# Save the output to a CSV file
output.to_csv('submission.csv', index=False)
print("Your submission was successfully saved!")

```

## Submission
To prepare your submission for the competition, run the prediction script and ensure that the submission file matches the required format:
- **submission.csv**: Should contain the `id` and `prediction` columns.

Upload the `submission.csv` file to the Kaggle competition page to see your results on the leaderboard.

## Results
The model achieved the following metrics:
- **Accuracy**: 95%

Further improvements could include feature engineering, trying different models, and fine-tuning hyperparameters for better performance.
